# bucket-operator
A Kubernetes operator for managing bucket resources. This operator creates and manages ConfigMaps based on Bucket CR, providing a simple way to manage storage bucket configurations in your Kubernetes cluster

## Description
The bucket-operator is a Kubernetes operator built with Kubebuilder that manages `Bucket` CR. When you create a Bucket resource, the operator:

- **Creates ConfigMaps**: Automatically creates a ConfigMap containg bucket configuration (size, name, region, storageType)
- **Manages Lifecycle**: Uses finalizers to ensure proper cleanup when buckets are deleted
- **Tracks Status**: Uses Kubernetes Conditions (Ready, Available, Progressing) to track the state of bucket resources
- **Validates Configuration**: Enforces validation rules on bucket specifications (size, name, region, storageType)

This operator serves as a learning project for understanding Kubernetes operators, controllers, finalizers, and webhooks. It demonstrates best practices for resource reconciliation, status management, and cleanup operations.

## Features

- Custom Resource Definition (CRD) for Bucket resources
- Automatic ConfigMap creation and synchronization
- Finalizer-based cleanup on resource deletion
- Status tracking with Kubernetes Conditions
- Validation of bucket specifications

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- go version v1.24.6+
- docker version 17.03+.
- kubectl version v1.11.3+.
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.11.3+ cluster.

### To Deploy on the cluster
**Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/bucket-operator:tag
```

**NOTE:** This image ought to be published in the personal registry you specified.
And it is required to have access to pull the image from the working environment.
Make sure you have the proper permission to the registry if the above commands don’t work.

**Install the CRDs into the cluster:**

```sh
make install
```

**Deploy the Manager to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/bucket-operator:tag
```

> **NOTE**: If you encounter RBAC errors, you may need to grant yourself cluster-admin
privileges or be logged in as admin.

**Create instances of your solution**
You can apply the samples (examples) from the config/sample:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

>**NOTE**: Ensure that the samples has default values to test it out.

### To Uninstall
**Delete the instances (CRs) from the cluster:**

```sh
kubectl delete -k config/samples/
```

**Delete the APIs(CRDs) from the cluster:**

```sh
make uninstall
```

**UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:**

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Project Distribution

Following the options to release and provide this solution to the users.

### By providing a bundle with all YAML files

1. Build the installer for the image built and published in the registry:

```sh
make build-installer IMG=<some-registry>/bucket-operator:tag
```

**NOTE:** The makefile target mentioned above generates an 'install.yaml'
file in the dist directory. This file contains all the resources built
with Kustomize, which are necessary to install this project without its
dependencies.

2. Using the installer

Users can just run 'kubectl apply -f <URL for YAML BUNDLE>' to install
the project, i.e.:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<org>/bucket-operator/<tag or branch>/dist/install.yaml
```

### By providing a Helm Chart

1. Build the chart using the optional helm plugin

```sh
kubebuilder edit --plugins=helm/v2-alpha
```

2. See that a chart was generated under 'dist/chart', and users
can obtain this solution from there.

**NOTE:** If you change the project, you need to update the Helm Chart
using the same command above to sync the latest changes. Furthermore,
if you create webhooks, you need to use the above command with
the '--force' flag and manually ensure that any custom configuration
previously added to 'dist/chart/values.yaml' or 'dist/chart/manager/manager.yaml'
is manually re-applied afterwards.

## Contributing
Nothing, because of learning project (base things)

**NOTE:** Run `make help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
